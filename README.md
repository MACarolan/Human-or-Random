Given arrays of strings of text and labels, develops a hypothesis to classify human-key bashing from pseudorandomly 
generated strings. ML parameters such as batch size and number of iterations can be specified as function parameters

Data processing code (within "Data Creator" folder) was all written by me

*Note this was created as a learning exercise, RandClassifier.py is based on Google's IMDB Tensorflow tutorial available here:
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_text_classification, with design choices such as one-hot encoding and several 
helper functions made by me
